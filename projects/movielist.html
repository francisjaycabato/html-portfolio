<h1>The Best Movies According to Francis-Jay</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite thought provoking film. It feels like something that could be a reality.
    <br>Harnessing the powers of a black hole in order to shape our future is not something that is 
    <br>made out of thin air.

<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
    <p>Really cool sci-fi movie.</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
    <p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
